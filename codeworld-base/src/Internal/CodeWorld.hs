-- | A computer program.
--
-- This is a specific task or application that a computer performs.  In
-- CodeWorld, programs are defined using one of the "entry point"
-- functions, such as 'drawingOf', 'animationOf', or 'activityOf'.
type Program = IO ()

-- | A program that displays a drawing of a single picture.
--
-- This is the simplest way to define a program in CodeWorld.  The
-- argument is a 'Picture'.
--
-- For example:
-- 
-- > program = drawingOf(codeWorldLogo)
drawingOf :: Picture -> Program
drawingOf pic = CW.drawingOf (toCWPic pic) `catch` reportError

-- | A program that shows an animation changing over time.
--
-- The argument is a function, which maps each time (a 'Number' in
-- seconds since the program started) to the 'Picture' that is shown
-- at that time.
--
-- For example:
-- 
-- > program = animationOf(f)
-- > f(t) = rotated(rectangle(5,5), 45 * t)
animationOf :: (Number -> Picture) -> Program
animationOf f = CW.animationOf (toCWPic . f . fromDouble) `catch` reportError

-- | A program that can interact with a user by responding to pointer
-- and keyboard events and remember state.
--
-- To create an activity, you first choose a type for its state,
-- called the "world" type.  You will then describe the activity
-- with three arguments:
--
-- 1. A function to create an initial world.  The argument to
--    this function is an infinite sequence of random numbers,
--    which you can use to create a randomly chosen world.
-- 2. A function that describes how the world changes when
--    things happen.  The function receives an old world and
--    an 'Event' that occurs, and maps it to a new world.
-- 3. A function that converts a world into a 'Picture', used
--    to display the program on the screen.
--
-- For example:
--
-- > program = activityOf(initial, change, picture)
-- >
-- > initial(rs) = 0
-- >
-- > change(x, KeyPress("A")) = x - 1
-- > change(x, KeyPress("D")) = x + 1
-- > change(x, other) = x
-- >
-- > picture(x) = translated(solidCircle(1), x, 0)
--
-- In mathematical language, an activity is called a dynamical
-- system.  The world type is known as the phase space of the
-- system, and the @change@ function is called the dynamics of
-- the system.  The @initial@ and @picture@ functions are not
-- part of the system, but describe how the program should
-- simulate and display it.
activityOf ::
       ( [Number] -> world
       , (world, Event) -> world
       , world -> Picture)
    -> Program
activityOf (initial, event, draw) = interactionOf (initial, fst, event, draw)

-- | A program that acts just like one built with 'activityOf',
-- but offers more tools to pause, rewind, and otherwise
-- understand the program behavior.  This can be used during
-- development, and then changed back to 'activityOf' once the
-- program is complete.

debugActivityOf (initial, event, draw) =
    debugInteractionOf (initial, fst, event, draw)

-- | A program that interacts with multiple different users by
-- responding to their pointer and keyboard events.
--
-- The arguments to this function are similar 'activityOf',
-- except that:
--
-- 1. A first argument, a 'Number' gives the desired number of
--    players.
-- 2. The @change@ function receives an extra argument telling
--    which player intiated the event.
-- 3. The @picture@ function receives an extra argument with
--    the player for whom the picture should be built.
--
-- The activity will always begin with a "lobby", where players
-- can create new games or join existing games with a code.
-- Once the desired number of players have joined, the activity
-- will begin.
